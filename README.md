# UX
* Buisness Goals 
    * The main goal of any restaurant is to attaract customers by their unique style of cuisine.
    In this case Fork & Knife is offering a mix of North Indian and South Indian dishes.
    * Other main goals are to attaract couples, families and childrens to book table with us.
    * Buisness is also responsible to promote unique style of menu which attracts all age groups.
* UserGoals
    * Having a healthy menu that attaracts families with their childrens.
    * Having the ability to know before hand on what to order and the prices.
    * Having the options to conatact the restaurant staff if in any doubt.
* User Stories
    * As a User I need to:
        * to be able to navigate through the website comfortably and easily.
        * to be able to see through mobile first and pass it to my peers.
        * to easily understand the purpose of the page.
        * to be able to find who owns the Buisness and how to contact them, This will give me more confidence to book a table and also the restaurant.
        * to be able to view some photos of popular dishes.
* Structure
    * I decided to separate the website into Four sections Home page, Menu page, (with 3 dropdown menu links) , Offers page and Contact page. 
    The navbar (fixed) and footer allow the user to easily find ways to get in touch and each page is to show a consistency throughout. 
    Each page is designed to provide practical information, with inspiring images and content enough to enable the user to know what the restaurant provides.

* Design Choices
    * Colors
        * ![Colors](/assets/images/colors.png)
            * The Color Palette is carefully selected to invite users and excite them to book a table. 
            It is also responsible to give a warm feeling and is inpired by the "Eye Comfort" reading mode for most screens.
    * Typography
        * There are two fonts used throughout the project, both with a serif fallback. These font-faces inspire classiness and elegance:
            * [Playfair](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?query=playfa&preview.text_type=custom) is used for all the call out headers.
            * [PT Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Serif?query=PT&preview.text_type=custom) is used for the rest of the text through out the body.
    * Media
        * All the images used through out the projects were carefully selected to potray a relation of what the containing section is about.
        * All images are sized and compressed for the best UX flow.
    * Icongraphy
        * Icons are used throughout the project to help user understand more efficiently the meaning of the content. They are a very good asset to improve UX.
