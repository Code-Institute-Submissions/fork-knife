# UX
## Buisness Goals 
* The main goal of any restaurant is to attaract customers by their unique style of cuisine.
  In this case Fork & Knife is offering a mix of North Indian and South Indian dishes.
* Other main goals are to attaract couples, families and childrens to book table with us.
* Buisness is also responsible to promote unique style of menu which attracts all age groups.
## UserGoals
* Having a healthy menu that attaracts families with their childrens.
* Having the ability to know before hand on what to order and the prices.
* Having the options to conatact the restaurant staff if in any doubt.
## User Stories
* As a User I need to:
    * to be able to navigate through the website comfortably and easily.
    * to be able to see through mobile first and pass it to my peers.
    * to easily understand the purpose of the page.
    * to be able to find who owns the Buisness and how to contact them, This will give me more confidence to book a table and also the restaurant.
    * to be able to view some photos of popular dishes.
## Structure
I decided to separate the website into Four sections Home page, Menu page, (with 3 dropdown menu links) , Offers page and Contact page. 
The navbar (fixed) and footer allow the user to easily find ways to get in touch and each page is to show a consistency throughout. 
Each page is designed to provide practical information, with inspiring images and content enough to enable the user to know what the restaurant provides.
