# EncounterdIssues
* ## Issues found during the process: 
    * Collapse Menu wont close back when cliciking on the icon again without selecting any dropdown links.
        * Fixed this by commenting out the unwanated JS Libraries bellow each page.
    * Other issues foud during the process was when using [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/). For example: ![Error](/assets/images/errorfoundonpage.png) These errors were found on all the pages which has buttons as links to different pages.
        * Fixed this by taking out *Button* tag from the *a* tag and kept the *a* tag on its own.

# TestingFunctionality
* ## Index page
    * Starting from top to bottom, left to right, click on every button, link, toggle to check for expected action.
        * top navigation fully functional including the brand title and logo.
        * Book a Table button toggles the modal form. The X button and clicking outsite the modal container closes the modal.
        * Modal form: submit button is submiting the form.
        * Footer: Social media buttons open each the expected link on a new tab.
* ## Offers, Contact and Menu Pages.
    * Starting from top to bottom, left to right, click on every button, link, toggle to check for expected action.
        * All the buttons in these pages take the user to the desired page.
* ## Testing browser back/forward action
    * Navigation: browser back and forward and mobile back tap acts as expected throughout. Although, when modal is opened, the back click/tap targets the url and it doesn't toggle/close the modal. In order to function like this, it requires further Javascript coding. This is left to be implemented.

Result as expected, all fields asked for input. The email field asks for email format with @ and the date and time fields cannot be filled differently.
